# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing brain tumor segmentation using deep learning techniques. The model leverages advanced neural networks to identify and segment brain tumors from medical imaging data, aiding in automated diagnosis and medical analysis.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or U-Net for segmentation.
- **Medical Image Processing**: Preprocessing techniques for MRI or CT scan images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Model training, validation, and testing on medical imaging datasets.
- **Visualization**: Displays segmented tumor regions on the images.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Brain_Tumor_Segmentation.git
   cd Brain_Tumor_Segmentation
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Brain_Tumor_Segmentation_using_Deep_Learning.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Dataset
- This project uses publicly available brain tumor datasets like **BraTS** (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge) or other MRI scan datasets.
- Download the dataset and update the data path in the notebook.

## Results
- The model outputs segmented tumor regions on input MRI images.
- Performance metrics such as Dice coefficient, IoU, and accuracy are evaluated.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please create an issue or submit a pull request for improvements.
